There are several types including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The key advantage of machine learning is its ability to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

These changes may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases. The effects include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. Scientists agree that limiting global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels will help us avoid the worst impacts.",
